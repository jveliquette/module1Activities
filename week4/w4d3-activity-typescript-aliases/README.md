# Defining Types

## Activity Description

This activity will have you building a Contact List application. There are two primary goals of this activity:

- Code Review
You must perform code review on the provided code to demonstrate an understanding of the how the program is working. This will help with defining Typescript aliases for the application's data, annotating types throughout the code, and exporting new application features.

- Applying Types, Adding Features
Once you have performed your static code analysis, you are to update the code with your own Typescript aliases and type annotations, replacing every instance of `any` with a truer, specific type.

## Requirements

- [ ] **Analyze the code**
Comments must be left above every line of starter code.
- [ ] **Define Types**
Type definitions and annotations are required for every function param, variable declaration, object
- [ ] **Replace `any` Types**
Starter code has type `any` applied throughout; you are required to replace these annotations with more specific types.
- [ ] **Generate and execute a JS distributable**
Code must be compiled and pass
- [ ] **Stretch**
There are Bonus TODOs and an empty function in the application. If you feel confident, add the missing functionality in existing functions, and/or write the function body logic that updates a contact in the contact list. Make sure you follow the above requirements for the added code.

Feel free to add console.log statements to help you debug the application, but please remove them before submitting.

## Expected Output

Running `npm start` should produce a Javascript distributable (transpiled source code) that produces no errors.

`data.json` file is updated to reflect additions, removals, and updates made to the contact list.
