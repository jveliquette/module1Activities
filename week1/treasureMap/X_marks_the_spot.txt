Inside the cave, there will be a talking bird that will ask you how your day has been. He will hand you a small trowel and tell you to start digging in the sand where the X is. When you get two feet down, you hear a small thud.
When you uncover the treasure box, you open it...and inside lies a $1 bill. Haha - oh well...
