# Pure Functions and Mutability

## Activity Description

In this project, you will work with a TypeScript file that contains code related to pure functions and mutability. Your task is to understand the behavior of the provided code, identify the impure function, and refactor it to make it pure. You will also use the reduce function to create a total based on the values in an array. Additionally, you will have a bonus challenge to refactor the function using the `filter` array method.

## Getting Started

1. Open the provided TypeScript file (`src/index.ts`) and read the code carefully to understand the behavior of the impure function.
2. Follow the instructions and comments in the code to complete the refactoring process.

## Requirements

- [ ] **Analyze the code**
Comments must be left above every line of starter code.
- [ ] **Define Types**
Type definitions and annotations are required for every function param, variable declaration, object
- [ ] **Replace `any` Types**
Starter code has type `any` applied throughout; you are required to replace these annotations with more specific types.
- [ ] **Generate and execute a JS distributable**
Code must be compiled and pass

Feel free to add console.log statements to help you debug the application, but please remove them before submitting.

## Note

There may be TypeScript errors when you first transpile the files, but that's expected. Work your way through the challenges, fixing, refactoring, and writing code as you go. Make sure to complete each task before moving on to the next.
